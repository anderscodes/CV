## Anders Persson

I am a maker who loves to create and build things from scratch. I have spent quite a lot of time pursuing creative projects such as making short films or music before getting a 'real' job where I introduced a very traditional company to the oppurtunities of online marketplaces and built a sucessful retail store for them on Amazon and eBay. I am looking for an opportunity to continue building and learning in a positive environment where I am encouraged to problem solve and create new things.

## Skills

#### Communication

Several years working in a sales/customer service environment with small businesses (who are often very temperamental) has taught me the importance of effective communication. I have built postive working relationships with customers and continued to foster these relationships over a number of years. While working with developers on a project to integrate marketplace sales activity I have experienced first hand how issues can be avoided through timely and efficient communication and the need to be exlicitly clear about the needs to the project to make sure the other party has understood fully. I am particularly proud of the 100% feedback rating I recieved while running the eBay store.

#### Dedication

With very little woodworking skills, I made the questionable decision to build an acoustic guitar. I completely under-estimated how difficult the project was and how long it would take but almost four years later the guitar is 90% finished. There were many times when I encountered a problem that made me feel like giving up but I continued to work through and have devoted countless hours to both thinking about and doing the project. Quite simply, when I am given a task to do I will finish it no matter what and I will not be able to stop working on it until I have finished.

#### Big sky thinking

At the company I used to work for, we had a problem. A large amount of slow moving and damaged stock and very little funds to invest in the website in order to sell them. I proposed selling on the Amazon and eBay marketplaces in order to expand our customer base and compete more effectively with the competition. I quite quicky had to indentify which products would be most appealing to customers and how to re-frame these products in order to sell them online. I was responsible for all aspects of the project so needed to be mindful of how each aspect would affect other areas of the business. The marketplaces continued to grow in sales and are now an essential part of the company's sales strategy.
